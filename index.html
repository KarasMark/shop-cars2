                <h1>Welcom to Cars Shop</h1>
                <p>Modern cars have been called “smartphones with wheels,” because they are connected to the internet
                    and packed with sensors and cameras. According to the complaint, an agent at Liberty Mutual told Mr.
                    Chicco that he had been rejected because of information in his “LexisNexis report.” LexisNexis Risk
                    Solutions, a data broker, has traditionally kept tabs for insurers on drivers’ moving violations,
                    prior insurance coverage and accidents.
                    When Mr. Chicco requested his LexisNexis file, it contained details about 258 trips he had taken in
                    his Cadillac over the past six months. His file included the distance he had driven, when the trips
                    started and ended, and an accounting of any speeding and hard braking or accelerating. The data had
                    been provided by General Motors — the manufacturer of his Cadillac.

                    In a complaint against General Motors and LexisNexis Risk Solutions filed in the U.S. District Court
                    for the Southern District of Florida, Mr. Chicco accused the companies of violation of privacy and
                    consumer protection laws. The lawsuit follows a report by The New York Times that, unknown to
                    consumers, automakers have been sharing information on their driving behavior with the insurance
                    industry, resulting in increased insurance rates for some drivers. LexisNexis Risk Solutions, and
                    another data broker called Verisk, claim to have real-world driving behavior from millions of cars.
